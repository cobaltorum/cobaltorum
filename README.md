TypeScript & OSS fanatic. I build whatever sounds like a good idea at 3 AM. Mostly tools no one asked for, side projects I’ll never finish, or frameworks that already exist (but mine has a supposedly cooler name). My stack consists of basically anything that lets me overengineer a todo app.

I love going to coffee shops and pretend I’m being productive.
