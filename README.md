TypeScript and OSS fanatic, part time builder of ideas, and full time coffee dependent.

I usually end up building tools nobody asked for, start side projects that rarely (if ever) get finished, or re invent existing frameworks but with a different name. Most of it ends up here as open source for anyone that might want to use it.
